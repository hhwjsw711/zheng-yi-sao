    title1: "Tian Suan",
    description1:
      "Tian Suan is a historical science fiction short story. The story is set in the Warring States period after the annihilation of a high-entropy civilization in ancient times. As high-entropy technology gradually evolved into indecipherable tadpole-like characters, these characters were treasured by successive Shang kings and kings of Song. When the king of Song, Luan, faced national peril, he invited Mozi and Gongshu Ban, two great talents, to try to decipher the tadpole characters in the hidden chamber in an attempt to save the nation's fate. Mozi studied the tadpole characters for many years, not only gaining advanced scientific knowledge to strengthen Song's defenses, but also gaining enlightenment on the way of salvation through 'universal love, non-aggression, and the pursuit of equality and virtuous leadership.' However, with the advent of siege weapons such as cloud ladders invented by Gongshu Ban under King Zhang of Chu, Song once again faced threats. A contest of technology and wisdom thus unfolded... Through the collision and fusion of ancient technology and ancient politics and culture, Tian Suan explores the complex relationship between technology and humanity, wisdom and power, salvation and self-preservation. The novel uses Mozi as the protagonist, centering on the core tenets of Mohism ('universal love, non-aggression, the pursuit of equality and virtuous leadership'), showcasing the pursuit of knowledge and truth by ancient wise men, as well as their adherence to peace and justice. Using this contest that transcends time and space, it conveys profound reflections on the harmonious coexistence of technology and humanity, as well as the eternal pursuit of the values of peace and justice.",

The fate of separation and reunion, the conflict of faith and pursuit; the mystery of paleontology and Pangaea, the entanglement of history and scientific philosophy; when all these propositions collide, the symphony of time and life resounds again, and the bell of human-cosmic connection rings again... The Song of the Aurora blends scientific research, cosmic mysteries, and human perseverance, reflecting humanity's resilience and courage in the face of unknown challenges, their unwavering pursuit of scientific exploration and truth; it also explores humanity's endless curiosity and pursuit of the unknown world, and the eternal theme of searching for the meaning of life in the vast universe.",
